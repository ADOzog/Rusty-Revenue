# Rusty-Revenue

A tax calculator written in Rust  
It could also help log personal finances

### Goals

1. To teach myself more about Rust

2. Learn how to do my own taxes

3. Work with some kind of database for managing finances
##### note
I will be able to work on this more once summer break begins but this may go untouched until then.
